# setup-protoc

This action makes the `protoc` compiler available to Workflows.

## Usage

To get the latest stable version of `protoc` just add this step:

```yaml
- name: Install Protoc
  uses: arduino/setup-protoc@master
```

If you want to pin a major or minor version you can use the `.x` wildcard:

```yaml
- name: Install Protoc
  uses: arduino/setup-protoc@master
  with:
    version: '3.x'
```

You can also require to include releases marked as `pre-release` in Github using the `include-pre-releases` flag (the dafault value for this flag is `false`)

```yaml
- name: Install Protoc
  uses: arduino/setup-protoc@master
  with:
    version: '3.x'
    include-pre-releases: true
```

To pin the exact version:

```yaml
- name: Install Protoc
  uses: arduino/setup-protoc@master
  with:
    version: '3.9.1'
```

## Development

To work on the codebase you have to install all the dependencies:

```sh
# npm install
```

To run the tests:

```sh
# npm run test
```

## Enable verbose logging for a pipeline
Additional log events with the prefix ::debug:: can be enabled by setting the secret `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` to `true`.

See [step-debug-logs](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-debugging.md#step-debug-logs) for reference.



## Release

We check in the `node_modules` to provide runtime dependencies to the system
using the Action, so be careful not to `git add` all the development dependencies
you might have under your local `node_modules`. To release a new version of the
Action the workflow should be the following:

1. `npm install` to add all the dependencies, included development.
1. `npm run test` to see everything works as expected.
1. `npm run build` to build the Action under the `./lib` folder.
1. `rm -rf node_modules` to remove all the dependencies.
1. `npm install --production` to add back **only** the runtime dependencies.
1. `git add lib node_modules` to check in the code that matters.
1. open a PR and request a review.
